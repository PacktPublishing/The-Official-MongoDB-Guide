# Notes on Code Snippets in Chapter 1

This folder contains a collection of MongoDB code snippets and schema examples for Chapter 1. These files are intended to support learning and reference for basic MongoDB concepts, document structure, and introductory queries.

## How to Read These Files

- **File Types:**
  - `.py` files: Contain Python scripts that interact with MongoDB, typically using a driver like PyMongo. These scripts can be run in a Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed.
  - `.bson` files: Contain example BSON documents or schema patterns. These are not runnable scripts, but illustrate document structure, data types, or schema design patterns in MongoDB.

- **Non-Runnable Snippets:**
  - Some files (especially `.bson` or those with partial documents) are for illustration only. They show how documents are structured, how fields are embedded, or how certain patterns are implemented in MongoDB.
  - These files may include placeholder values, ellipses (`...`), or comments to indicate omitted or example data.
  - You can use these as templates or references when designing your own schemas or queries.

- **Runnable Code:**
  - Most `.py` files are complete scripts and can be run as-is, provided you have a suitable MongoDB instance and the required Python packages installed.
  - Some scripts assume the existence of certain collections or data. Review the code and adapt as needed for your environment.

## Best Practices

- Always review code before running it in a production environment.
- Use the examples as learning aids or starting points for your own MongoDB projects.
- Refer to the chapter or section in the documentation for context on each snippet.
