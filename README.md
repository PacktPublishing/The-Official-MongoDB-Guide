Delivering secure, scalable, and high-performance applications is never easy, especially when systems must handle growth, protect sensitive data, and perform reliably under pressure. The Official MongoDB Guide addresses these challenges with guidance from MongoDB’s top subject matter experts, so you learn proven best practices directly from those who know the technology inside out.
This book takes you from core concepts and architecture through to advanced techniques for data modeling, indexing, and query optimization, supported by real-world patterns that improve performance and resilience. It offers practical coverage of developer tooling, IDE integrations, and AI-assisted workflows that will help you work faster and more effectively.
Security-focused chapters walk you through authentication, authorization, encryption, and compliance, while chapters dedicated to MongoDB Atlas showcase its robust security features and demonstrate how to deploy, scale, and leverage platform-native capabilities such as Atlas Search and Atlas Vector Search.
By the end of this book, you’ll be able to design, build, and manage MongoDB applications with the confidence that comes from learning directly from the experts shaping the technology.</details>
