# Chapter 6: Developer Tools

This chapter explores essential MongoDB developer tools, including IDE extensions, Compass, and the MCP Server. The code and configuration snippets provided here illustrate practical usage and integration of these tools to enhance productivity and streamline development workflows.

## Key Topics

- **IDE Extensions**: Integrate MongoDB with popular development environments like Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA for seamless data exploration, query prototyping, and enhanced developer experience.
- **MongoDB Compass**: Use Compass as a graphical interface for database management, query construction, schema analysis, and leveraging AI-powered natural language querying.
- **MongoDB MCP Server**: Connect AI agents and clients to MongoDB clusters for natural language queries and advanced data management.

# Notes on Code Snippets in Chapter 6

This folder contains a collection of MongoDB code snippets and configuration examples for Chapter 6. These files support learning and reference for developer tools, IDE integrations, query prototyping, aggregation pipelines, and AI-enabled features in MongoDB.

## How to Read These Files

- **File Types:**
  - `.js` files: MongoDB Shell commands or JavaScript code for use in VS Code Playground or similar environments. Some are runnable directly; others are illustrative or contain placeholders.
  - `.conf` files: Configuration examples for enabling features in MongoDB tools (e.g., Compass, MCP Server). These may require adaptation for your environment.

- **Non-Runnable Snippets:**
  - Some files (especially those with placeholder syntax, ellipses (`...`), or incomplete code) are for illustration only. They demonstrate concepts, configuration, or output structure. Use these as templates or references when designing your own queries or tool configurations.

- **Runnable Code:**
  - Most `.js` files are complete examples and can be run as-is in a suitable test environment. Some scripts assume the existence of certain collections or dataâ€”review and adapt as needed for your setup.

## Topics Covered

- IDE extensions for MongoDB (VS Code, IntelliJ)
- Data exploration and query prototyping
- Aggregation pipelines and CRUD operations
- MongoDB Compass features and configuration
- AI-enabled querying and MCP Server integration

## Best Practices

- Review code before running in a production environment.
- Use these examples as learning aids or starting points for your own MongoDB projects.
- Refer to the chapter or official documentation for context on each snippet.
